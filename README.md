NEISS database analysis from 2007 to 2016

## file source

CPSC’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) is a probability sample of hospitals in the U.S. and its territories that have at least six beds and an emergency department. The NEISS is a stratified sample based on emergency department size and geographic location. The emergency department size is categorized by the annual number of emergency department visits reported by each hospital. Currently, there is also a stratum of children’s hospitals. Patient information is collected nightly from each NEISS hospital for every patient treated in the emergency department for an injury associated with consumer products.  https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/webestimates.html

Methodology: 
NEISS hospitals are a stratified probability sample of all U.S. hospitals that have at least 6 beds and provide 24 hour emergency department (ED) services. Five strata are included, four representing hospitals of different sizes, and the fifth representing children's hospitals. At each NEISS hospital, an NEISS hospital coordinator reviews all ED records daily; selects those that meet the criteria for inclusion in NEISS; abstracts pertinent data from the selected records; and transcribes the data in coded form to a NEISS coding sheet. Coded data and a narrative are transmitted electronically to the NEISS program where quality assurance coders review and complete the coding. Data are weighted to produce national estimates. Follow-back investigations to obtain more information about the likely causes of the incident are conducted for certain incidents through telephone and on-site interviews with the patient or patient's relative. https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/data-source/national-electronic-injury-surveillance-system
