NEISS database analysis from 2007 to 2016

## file source

CPSC’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) is a probability sample of hospitals in the U.S. and its territories that have at least six beds and an emergency department. The NEISS is a stratified sample based on emergency department size and geographic location. The emergency department size is categorized by the annual number of emergency department visits reported by each hospital. Currently, there is also a stratum of children’s hospitals. Patient information is collected nightly from each NEISS hospital for every patient treated in the emergency department for an injury associated with consumer products.  https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/webestimates.html
